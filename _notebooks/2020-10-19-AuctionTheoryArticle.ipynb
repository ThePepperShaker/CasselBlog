    "The 2020 Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul R. Milgrom and Robert B. Wilson \"for improvements to auction theory and inventions of new auction formats\". <br> As a current student of Economics taking a course in advanced microeconomics, this work intrigued me. Moreover, I have dedicated some of my free time to reading a book by Shoshanna Zuboff titled \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\", wherein Chapter 3 she discusses how Google revolutionzed their online advertising by initiating an ad auction system called AdWorks, intially devised by lead Economist of Google Hal Varian.
