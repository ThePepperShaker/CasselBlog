    "The 2020 Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul R. Milgrom abd Robert B. Wilson \"for imporvements to auction theroy and invetions of new auction formats\". <br> As a current student of Economics taking a course in advanced microeconomics, this work intrigued me. Moreover, I have dedicated some of my free time to reading a book by Shoshanna Zuboff titled \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism\", wherein Chapter 3 she discusses how Google revolutionzed their online advertising by appealing to an ad auction system, devised by lead Economist Hal Varian.
